# ðŸ¥‹ DOJO Online Judge Orchestrator

DOJO is an online judge that orchestrates other online judges, so you can simulate ICPC-like competitions with problems from multiple sources.

This project is currently at an early development state, so I believe that there is no point in trying to use it or contribute to it _right now_. If you are interested and feel like helping somehow, feel free to contact me on [telegram](https://t.me/wdsrocha) or [e-mail](mailto:wesleysr1997@gmail.com). If you are looking for a similar project instead, take a look at [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/) and [A2 Online Judge](https://a2oj.com/).
