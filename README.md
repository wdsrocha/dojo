# ðŸ¥‹ DOJO Online Judge Orchestrator

DOJO is an online judge that orchestrates other online judges, so you can simulate [ICPC-like competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) with problems from multiple sources, like [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/), [Online Judge (old UVa)](https://onlinejudge.org/), [URI](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) and more. It's similar to [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/).
