# ðŸ¥‹ DOJO Online Judge Orchestrator

DOJO is an online judge that orchestrates other online judges, so you can simulate [ICPC-like competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) with problems from multiple sources, like [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/), [Online Judge (old UVa)](https://onlinejudge.org/), [URI](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) and more.

This project is currently at an early development state, so I believe that there is no point in trying to use it or contribute to it _right now_. If you are interested and feel like helping somehow, feel free to contact me on [telegram](https://t.me/wdsrocha) or [e-mail](mailto:wesleysr1997@gmail.com). If you are looking for a similar project instead, take a look at [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/).
